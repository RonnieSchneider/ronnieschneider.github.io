# Project Summary
The philosophy behind the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) instrument is that it brings order to the chaos of every day choices; all of our seemingly random and unpredictable behaviors are in fact consistent patterns. The test determines an individual’s tendencies in four areas: Extroversion/Introversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving, yielding 16 types.
Understanding personality type may help strengthen many areas of a person’s life. Type understanding may also benefit employee management, customer service, and marketing.
This text mining/predictive analysis project yields a model that can predict MBTI type based upon a text sample, rather than a formal test.

## Competition

My team's project was selected as a finalist in the [2018 Teradata University Network Analytics Challenge](https://www.teradatauniversitynetwork.com/Community/Student-Competitions/2018/2018-TUN-Challenge-Finalists)

 I will be competing against 14 other teams in Las Vegas at the [Teradata Universe Conference](https://analyticsuniverse.teradata.com/) in October.

The image at the top of the page is the poster for the event.

Check out my [Shiny app](https://ronnieschneider.shinyapps.io/MBTI_prediction_Shiny/) that provides an overview of MBTI type and two graphics based upon the project data set.
